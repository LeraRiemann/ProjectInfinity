# Infinite Dimensions

**Infinite Dimensions** is a mod that reworks and reimagines 20w14infinite - the April Fools' snapshot of 2020 - in Minecraft 1.21.1.

Get a Book and Quill, write anything in it, and throw it into a Nether Portal - and the portal will change its color before your eyes. Beyond lies one of 2.1+ billion dimensions this mod can generate! Whacky terrain, crazy sky colors and funky flora made out of random blocks - there's a possibility to find all this and more on the other side.

Most features in the mod are fully configurable in terms of their spawning chances and block selection weights. This allows you to easily introduce blocks (mobs, fluids etc.) from other mods to this mod's dimensions - or, say, remove the chance for dimensions where netherite generates instead of stone. I made a detailed [guide](https://lerariemann.neocities.org/var/mod-configuration) on how to use all the config options.

Please make sure to report any problems you have with the mod on its [issue tracker](https://github.com/LeraRiemann/ProjectInfinity/issues) or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NrvaQWV7Qv). By "problems", I mean anything that leads to excessive lag, mass entity spawning, broken datapack creation etc. *under default mod configuration*.

### Can I use this mod in a video or a similar form of content?
Absolutely, if you link back to here!

### Can I use it in a modpack or as a dependency?
Also yes, though keep in mind that it's still in beta, and there might be hidden bugs, crashes and instabilities - although I'm trying to fix them as soon as they arise.

### Are there Easter Egg dimensions?
Yes! The set is a bit different from the original snapshot though, since it is a new vision :D The list of them is fairly easy to find in source files, and you can even add your own entries to that list for modpacks etc.

### I want to suggest a feature/Easter Egg!
You can do so on my Discord, but make sure to stay respectful and don't expect much, especially in terms of ETAs. I can implement ideas that I like (and that aren't super hard to implement) when I have time and resources, but I never can promise when would that be.

### Acknowledgements
I appreciate [Cassian](https://cassian.cc), for their plethora of bugfixing commits and hosting a server for the mod, and BasiqueEvangelist, for helping with runtime dimension registration on Fabric and his permission to port a part of his code.

The NeoForge version of the mod would not be possible without the work of the Sinytra team on the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api), and Commoble's [infiniverse](https://github.com/Commoble/infiniverse/tree/main) library, which was referenced to troubleshoot errors with runtime dimension ticking on NeoForge.

This mod also has copyright-free music from [ivory rosewood](https://www.youtube.com/@ivorysoundtracks980) - she's an amazing person, check her out! - that I hid among the dimensions. See if you're able to find it out there, it's pretty rare :D
