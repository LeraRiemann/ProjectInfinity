# Infinite Dimensions - Alpha 1.3.0 for Minecraft 1.20.1

**Infinite Dimensions** is a mod that reworks and reimagines 20w14infinite - the April Fools' snapshot of 2020 - in modern versions of Minecraft.

Get a book and quill, write anything in it and throw it into a nether portal - and the portal will change its color before your eyes. Beyond lies one of 2.1+ billion dimensions this mod can generate! Whacky terrain, crazy sky colors and funky flora made out of random blocks - there's a possibility to find all this and more on the other side.

Most features in the mod are fully configurable in terms of their spawning chances and block selection weights. This allows you to easily introduce blocks (mobs, fluids etc.) from other mods to this mod's dimensions - or, say, remove the chance for dimensions where netherite generates instead of stone. A detailed guide on how to use this feature may be accessed on the [wiki](https://github.com/LeraRiemann/ProjectInfinity/wiki/Configuring-the-mod).

Please make sure to report any problems you have with the mod (i'm well aware problems may arise, it's alpha after all) on this GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/LeraRiemann/ProjectInfinity/issues). By "problems" i mean anything that leads to excessive lag, mass entity spawning, broken datapack creation etc. *under default mod configuration*. When doing so, please make sure to include the world seed as well as the dimension seed. The latter can be seen on the F3 screen in a line like "infinity:generated_13643626 FC: 0" - in this case, 13643626 is the seed.

## Known incompatibilities

* **Sodium** - due to a bug in Sodium, it does not render the portal colours correctly. This will be fixed in the upcoming version of Sodium (0.5).

I appreciate BasiqueEvangelist for helping with runtime dimension registration and his permission to port a part of his code.

This mod also has copyright-free music from [ivory rosewood](https://www.youtube.com/@ivorysoundtracks980) - she's an amazing person, check her out! - that i hid among the dimensions. See if you're able to find it out there, it's pretty rare :D
