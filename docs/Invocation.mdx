Cosmic Invocation is the process of generating config files for all loaded mods. In the older versions,
players had to construct and activate their own Transfinite Altar to enrich the multiverse with modded content;
now this process is performed automatically by a special Cosmic Altar.

In singleplayer, invocation happens on the first couple of ticks of the first world created on a new game instance
(since config files are shared between all the worlds on an instance). On a server, it is performed the instant the first player
joins the game.

Currently, the config files and therefore types of modded content which the invocation is able to scan for and introduce to dimensions are:
* blocks,
* fluids,
* mobs,
* sounds,
* items,
* particles,
* biomes and surface rules for them.

Blocks are auto-assigned tags needed for the generator to know which parts of worldgen are they usable for ("full", "laggy" etc.,
see the page on [configuring the mod](Configuring-the-mod)). Mobs are auto-sorted
into sublists based on their spawn group (monsters, underwater creatures etc.). Music is also auto-chosen from the list of sounds,
although the way the game checks for that is currently imperfect (it just checks if the ID of the sound event contains the
substrings "music" or "disc"). When scanning for biomes, the game ignores all the ones from Infinite Dimensions itself as to not
introduce mod-generated biomes into the pool of ones to choose from when you specifically want to _not_ generate one.

All the entries in all these lists are assigned the default weight of 1.0. You're free to edit these weights as you wish after
the invocation if you want to tweak the rarity of certain blocks/mobs/etc. or disable some of them from appearing in mod's dimensions
altogether (set the weight to 0.0 for that).

## Known issues with invocation
* Invocation only happens once per game folder. As such, if you add new mods to the instance after you already loaded worlds on it once,
invocation will not happen again. This especially stands for the default Minecraft launcher by Mojang, which by design only uses one.
To force the invocation to happen again, you can either construct and activate the Transfinite Altar, or delete the file
`config/infinity/modular/invocation.lock` and relaunch the game.
    * Note that such reinvocation will not touch any of the existing files, only add new ones. As such, it is useful by itself only when
    adding new mods to the instance. If you update one of the mods (including Infinite Dimensions!) to a newer version that brings
    more content, or *especially* if you remove mods, you have to purge the `/config/modular` folder entirely to do a successful reinvocation.
* Invocation takes time; it's only two game ticks, but using creative mode and saved hotbars / the warp command it is technically possible to
 prompt the game to generate a dimension before the invocation completes (especially since during invocation the server can lag a bit
 on larger modpacks). Please try to avoid that.
* Particle types sometimes have additional configuration options required to use them. These options are accounted for when it comes
to particles from vanilla Minecraft, but if another mod adds such a configurable particle, Infinite Dimensions will have no idea it is
configurable - which can lead to creation of broken datapacks. I do not currently know of any mod which does add particles which require such
configuration options and crash without them, which is why i left particles on the list; if it becomes a problem, i will remove them
from it.
