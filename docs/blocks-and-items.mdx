## Biome Bottle

Biome Bottles allow for changing the surrounding biome to one obtained from a Chaos Creeper.
- Empty ones are obtainable by throwing Glass Bottles into an Infinity Portal
- Using a Biome Bottle on a Chaos Creeper will extract the biome from the Creeper into the bottle.
- You can combine with other bottles of the same biome to increase stored charge in the crafting grid.
- You can release the biome by placing the Biome Bottle on a Transfinite Altar, and then clicking the altar with an empty hand.

## Box of Infinite Books

The Box of Infinite Books will give an infinite amount of the same book, determined by the block's position in the world.
Move the Book Box, you'll get new books.

- The Box of Infinite Books is craftable by throwing Bookshelf blocks into an Infinity Portal.

## A Very Fine Item

When eaten, A Very Fine Item will send you back to your respawn point.

## Footprint

Footprint items are entirely decorative.

## Iridescence

Iridescence is a colourful fluid that when touched gives the player colourful shaders and sends you on a journey through dimensions.
Iridescence will also can convert mobs to their chaos variety (skeletons, creepers and slimes).
Chaos Creepers will inherit the biome in which they are in when converted, which can be quite useful when paired with Biome Bottles.

## Infinity Portal

The Infinity Portal is the base of the mod. Throwing a Book and Quill, Written Book, or Transfinite Key into a Nether Portal
will convert it into a colourful and random Infinity Portal.

- Infinity Portals can also be used for Portal Crafting, tossing various items in will result in them changing form (TNT to Reset Charge, Lectern to Transfinite Altar, etc.)
A full list of crafting recipes can be found in EMI.

## Reset Charge

The Reset Charge is an anti-lag tool that can be used to erase dimension definition files - if you place and activate one,
the dimension you're in becomes "timebombed" which means it will be deleted on the next server restart.
It is immediately unusable and all existing players rapidly start taking damage to get them out.
HOWEVER, the chunk data is not erased, so if the dimension is reopened, all the block changes in there will still be present.

- Obtained by throwing TNT into an Infinity Portal.
- Activated by Shift + Right Click with an empty hand.
- Right click picks them up.

They are not usable in non-infinite dimensions.

## Transfinite Key

Transfinite Keys can be used to move and copy portals.
- Throwing an Amethyst Shard into an Infinity Portal will give you a key linked to that dimension.
- Throwing a Transfinite Key into a Nether or Infinity Portal will create a portal that links to the dimension stored inside the key.

## Transfinite Altar

Transfinite Altars have multiple unique purposes.
- As a decorative block, they can be dyed by right clicking with a dye (like signs), and given a pattern by right clicking with a sunflower.
- They can be used for [Invocation](Invocation) if you have added more mods since you first started playing with Infinite Dimensions.
- When a Biome Bottle is placed on them, they can be right clicked to release the biome inside to the surrounding area.
